[00:04.00] Hello my name is Claude Robert
[00:08.87] And I'd like to thank you for spending time with the gay parade
[00:11.83] We hope you found it enjoyable
[00:14.26] And that we will see you again very soon
[00:16.86] Because we've grown quite fond of you
[00:18.71] And all agree that you make very pleasant company
[00:43.21] 
[00:23.19] If you ever feel that in your life
[00:25.53] The moments of gaiety
[00:26.52] Are too few
[00:27.67] You can always come and visit us
[00:29.32] Now that you know the way
[00:32.43] And perhaps someday
[00:35.05] You'll be able to stay with us
[00:39.23] Forever inside the gay parade
